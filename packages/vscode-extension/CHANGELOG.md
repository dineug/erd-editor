# Changelog

## [2.3.2] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Import GraphQL SDL, DBML and Azimutt AML files, including legacy AML v1, as diagrams.
- Generate Go structs, code for SQLAlchemy, TypeORM, Sequelize and Drizzle, and DBML or AML
  schemas.
- Add Databricks and Snowflake support, including DDL generation, SQL import and data-type
  suggestions.
- Copy and paste selected tables or memos, duplicate them with Alt+drag, and use their tab-separated
  or HTML clipboard representations outside the editor.
- Expand data-type suggestions for every supported database vendor.

### Changed

- Route relationship lines around tables with more compact connectors and easier hit targets.
- Replace editor icons with Lucide outlines while preserving crow's-foot relationship notation.
- Make Schema SQL and Code Generator output selectable, and group the generator's language menu by
  kind.
- Filter Import and Diff file pickers by the selected format.

### Fixed

- Make SQL import robust across complex `CREATE` forms, three-part identifiers, multi-word types,
  quoted names, comments, identity columns, nested options and unmatched `]`, preventing hangs,
  phantom columns and lost schema detail.
- Generate valid GraphQL schemas and map vendor types and unique constraint names correctly in
  generated output.
- Stabilize relationship routing and large-diagram dragging, and correct index-column selection in
  the table properties panel.
- Preserve angle-bracket code while highlighting, and deliver copy and paste keys to text fields
  rather than the canvas.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed

- Minimum supported VSCode is now `1.90.0` (was `1.85.0`), which is the first release running on
  Node 20.

### Fixed

- Import no longer accepts a file whose extension merely ends with the expected one — `sample.xjson`
  was being read as JSON.
- Closing an ERD tab while it was still opening left the editor's resources behind.
- Running an ERD command from the editor title bar could open the file in an unintended editor group.
- Saving a theme could pick the wrong settings scope when the existing value was empty.
- A single theme change no longer pushes the same update to the webview several times.
